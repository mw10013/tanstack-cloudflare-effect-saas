Analyze the document and extract structured invoice data according to the provided JSON schema.

Rules:
- Set isInvoice to true only if the document is clearly an invoice.
- If isInvoice is false, set all other fields to empty string "".
- Extract only information explicitly present in the document. Never infer or guess values.
- Set fields to empty string "" when the information is not found in the document.
- Keep amounts as strings exactly as they appear in the document, including currency symbols (e.g., "$5.39", "$0.011 per 1,000").
- Keep dates as strings in whatever format appears in the document.
- For line items, include every line item found. Set quantity, unitPrice, or amount to empty string "" if not clearly stated for that item.
- For addresses, concatenate all address components into a single string (e.g., "101 Townsend Street, San Francisco, California 94107, United States"). Set to empty string "" if no address is found.
