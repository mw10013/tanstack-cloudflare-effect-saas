# Invoice Extraction Model Capacity Research

## Question

Are our invoice extraction failures mainly a timeout/infrastructure problem, or are the models themselves not capable enough for this task?

## Current setup

Grounded in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts`:

- `INVOICE_EXTRACTION_MODEL` is now `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:38` for the next experiment.
- The schema includes invoice header fields plus `lineItems: Schema.Array(LineItemSchema)` in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:23`.
- The prompt explicitly says: `For line items, include every line item found.` in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:71`.
- The code now has two request shapes: classic Workers AI text-generation JSON mode for the previous models, and Responses API structured output for the OSS OpenAI models in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:86` and `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:97`.
- The OSS OpenAI path requests structured output via `text.format = { type: "json_schema", name, schema, strict }` and reads `output_text`, then validates against the same invoice schema in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:98` and `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:113`.
- The output token cap remains `8192`, now via `max_output_tokens`, so the main failures are not explained by the old default token cap.
- We now have both code paths: binding via `runInvoiceExtraction()` and REST via `runInvoiceExtractionViaGateway()` in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:91` and `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:151`.

## Relevant docs grounding

### Workers AI JSON mode

From `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/docs/workers-ai/features/json-mode.mdx:112`:

> This is the list of models that now support JSON Mode

From `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/docs/workers-ai/features/json-mode.mdx:126`:

> Workers AI can't guarantee that the model responds according to the requested JSON Schema. Depending on the complexity of the task and adequacy of the JSON Schema, the model may not be able to satisfy the request in extreme situations. If that's the case, then an error `JSON Mode couldn't be met` is returned and must be handled.

This matters because a failure in JSON mode is not automatically a timeout. It can mean the model + constrained decoder cannot satisfy the schema.

### AI Gateway binding limits

From `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/docs/ai-gateway/usage/providers/workersai.mdx:118`:

- `id`
- `skipCache`
- `cacheTtl`

The binding path does not expose a request-timeout knob. That makes it a poor path for long-running structured extraction experiments.

### AI Gateway request timeout

From `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/docs/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling.mdx:39`:

> For a Universal Endpoint, configure the timeout value by setting a `requestTimeout` property within the provider-specific `config` object.

And the REST path also supports gateway timeout headers, which is why `runInvoiceExtractionViaGateway()` adds `cf-aig-request-timeout` in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:178`.

### Workers AI OSS OpenAI models

From `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/changelog/workers-ai/2025-08-05-openai-open-models.mdx:12`:

> Get started with the new models at `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` and `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b`.

From `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/changelog/workers-ai/2025-08-05-openai-open-models.mdx:17`:

> Workers Binding, it will accept/return Responses API – `env.AI.run("@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b")`

This is the important nuance: these models are available on Workers AI, but they do not slot into the older `prompt` + `response_format` path exactly the same way. They use Responses API input/output shapes.

## Experiments run so far

## Binding-path results

| Model | JSON mode support | Full line items | Result | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` | official | no | success | ~31s |
| `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` | official | yes | timeout (`3046` seen in gateway) | ~60s on binding path |
| `@cf/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` | official | yes | `5024 JSON Mode couldn't be met` | binding path masked this badly |
| `@cf/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-fp8` | not official | yes | timeout | ~60s |
| `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` | not official | yes | malformed JSON string | fast |

## REST-path results

Using `runInvoiceExtractionViaGateway()` improved observability:

- With a 120s gateway timeout, the request actually ran for about 120s and returned `2014: Provider request timeout`.
- With a 300s gateway timeout, llama still failed at about 120s with `3046: Request timeout`.
- DeepSeek R1 ran for about `544,143ms` and then returned `5024: JSON Mode couldn't be met`.

Key implication: increasing the gateway timeout helps us observe the true provider behavior, but it does not remove Workers AI's internal limits.

## Current experiment in code

The code is now set up to test the stronger OSS OpenAI Workers AI model directly:

- model: `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- transport: same `env.AI.run(...)` / Workers AI path
- request shape: Responses API, not classic text-generation JSON mode
- structured output request: `text.format.type = "json_schema"`
- decoder path: `output_text` -> invoice schema validation

Why this is a good next experiment:

- keeps the provider as Workers AI
- changes the model family and API surface together, as Cloudflare intends for these models
- avoids the mistaken assumption that `gpt-oss-120b` can be tested by only swapping the old model name under the old request shape

## Latest server-log result

We now have two distinct `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` results in `logs/server.log`.

### Run 1 - fast provider response, local decode failure

- request path: gateway REST API against Workers AI
- model: `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- elapsed time: `67,879ms`
- result: response returned successfully from the provider
- failure point: local decode/validation, not provider timeout

What came back:

- The model returned a full Responses API payload under `result`, not a top-level `output_text` field.
- The response included long reasoning output plus a final assistant message containing JSON text.
- The generated JSON was not valid for our schema as-is.

Concrete evidence from the log:

- Our decoder failed with `Missing key at ["output_text"]`.
- The assistant message text contained malformed JSON: after `"amount": "$0.00"` the payload had an extra comma/newline before `"period"`.

Takeaway from run 1:

- not a timeout problem
- partly our decode bug
- partly malformed model output

### Run 2 - decode fix landed, successful extraction

After fixing the local Responses decoder to unwrap `result.output[*].content[*].text`, the next run succeeded.

Grounding from `logs/server.log`:

- server-fn request at `logs/server.log:22`
- gateway returned in `elapsedMs: 536` at `logs/server.log:32`
- decoded invoice object logged at `logs/server.log:36`

What this means:

- The latest run was extremely fast, around half a second through the gateway path.
- The decode-path bug was real and materially blocked the earlier experiment.
- At least on this successful run, `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` produced output that decoded into our full invoice schema, including many line items and totals.

Important caution:

- The AI Gateway dashboard suggests this successful run was likely served from cache.
- That means `~536ms` is not a trustworthy uncached model-latency number.
- We have not yet proven this is consistently reliable across repeated runs.
- The earlier malformed-output run still matters. Current evidence is now mixed but much more promising.

### Cache caveat

The first meaningful uncached-looking `gpt-oss-120b` run took about `67,879ms`, while later very fast runs appear to be cache hits.

From Cloudflare's AI Gateway caching docs in `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/docs/ai-gateway/features/caching.mdx:80`:

> You can use the header **cf-aig-skip-cache** to bypass the cached version of the request.

So for further latency research, the REST path should explicitly send `cf-aig-skip-cache: true`. Without that, dashboard timings and UI timings are too easy to misread.

## Findings

### 1. This does not look like just an underpowered-model problem

- A 70B official JSON-mode model still times out on the full schema.
- A 32B reasoning model can run for 9+ minutes and still fail schema satisfaction.
- Faster non-official models are not a clean comparison because they appear not to do constrained decoding reliably.
- `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` has now shown both behaviors: one uncached-looking ~68s run and one cached-looking very fast successful decode.

If this were only about model size, the 70B official model would be more convincing than it currently is. Instead, the results point to a harder interaction between model capability, constrained decoding, large array-of-object output, and noisy markdown input.

### 2. The task shape is probably too expensive for one-shot constrained decoding on Workers AI

The current request asks for all of these at once:

- classify whether it is an invoice
- extract header metadata
- extract addresses
- extract totals
- emit every line item as an array of objects

For this invoice, the line-item section is the expensive part. Header-only extraction already succeeds. Full extraction with `lineItems` is where the system breaks down.

### 3. The real bottleneck is likely schema complexity plus constrained decoding, not `max_tokens`

`max_tokens` is already `8192` in `src/lib/invoice-extraction.ts:87`.

The stronger signal is Cloudflare's own JSON mode warning that the model may not be able to satisfy the requested schema in extreme situations in `refs/cloudflare-docs/src/content/docs/workers-ai/features/json-mode.mdx:126`.

### 4. REST is the right experimentation path

The binding path collapses too much useful error detail. The REST path gives us structured provider errors and request IDs, and lets us force uncached requests with `cf-aig-skip-cache`, which makes the next experiments much more interpretable.

### 5. `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` changes the shape of the problem

The new experiment suggests a different failure profile:

- not the old upstream timeout wall
- not the explicit `JSON Mode couldn't be met` path we saw with DeepSeek
- instead, a mix of very fast successful responses and at least one malformed-output response

That is meaningful. It suggests this model family may avoid the worst constrained-decoding timeout behavior, but reliability still needs repeated validation.

## Assessment

My read today:

- The evidence does not support a simple conclusion of `the models are underpowered`.
- The evidence does support `Workers AI JSON mode struggles with this specific one-shot extraction shape`.
- Model capability is still part of the story, but the bigger issue seems to be structured-output reliability under a large schema with many line items.
- `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` now adds a new nuance: stronger/faster models may avoid timeout and can succeed, but output correctness may still vary run to run.

So far the strongest updated read is:

- older Workers AI JSON-mode path: often too slow or cannot satisfy the schema
- `gpt-oss-120b` Responses path: promising, and demonstrably capable of decoding into the full schema on at least one run
- remaining questions: uncached latency and consistency

## Recommended next experiments

### A. Best next experiment: Workers AI `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`

This is now the active experiment.

Why:

- strongest of the two OSS OpenAI models on Workers AI
- tests whether a different model family on the same provider performs better
- keeps the rest of the system mostly unchanged apart from the request/response shape Cloudflare requires for this model family
- can now be measured more cleanly through REST with explicit cache bypass

What we want to learn:

- does `gpt-oss-120b` keep returning valid schema-conforming JSON for the full invoice across repeated runs?
- is its uncached latency consistently acceptable? Right now the best grounded number is still about `67,879ms`.
- when it fails, does it fail as malformed JSON, schema drift, or extraction-quality error?

Immediate follow-up if it fails:

- run the same extraction several more times with REST + `cf-aig-skip-cache: true`
- compare decoded outputs for stability and completeness
- if failures recur, capture whether they are malformed JSON or content-quality misses
- then try header-only extraction
- compare full schema vs line-items-only schema

### B. Isolate the expensive part on Workers AI

Before declaring Workers AI unworkable, split the current task into smaller experiments:

1. header/totals only schema
2. line-items only schema
3. line-items only, but limited to a single page or chunk
4. line-items only, but only non-zero amount items

If header extraction keeps succeeding and line-items-only keeps failing, we will have much cleaner evidence that arrays of objects are the real break point.

### C. Compare structured Responses API vs free-form JSON text

Try the same Workers AI model without constrained decoding:

- prompt for JSON text
- parse + validate after the fact

If this succeeds much faster, that strongly suggests structured decoding is the main bottleneck, not raw comprehension.

## Working hypothesis

Current best hypothesis:

The limiting factor is not simply model size. It is the combination of:

- noisy markdown converted from PDF
- a large output schema
- many `lineItems` as array-of-object output
- constrained JSON decoding on Workers AI

`@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` is worth testing next because it can answer the most important question quickly:

Is the task itself too large, or were the earlier failures mainly a limitation of the earlier Workers AI model paths we tested?
