# Invoice Status Model Research

## Status Model Redesign

### Current Statuses

| Status | Set Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `uploaded` | `repo.upsertInvoice` (OrganizationRepository.ts:61) | File in R2, DB record created |
| `extracting` | `repo.setExtracting` (OrganizationRepository.ts:97) | Extraction workflow running |
| `extracted` | `repo.saveExtraction` (OrganizationRepository.ts:125) | AI extraction complete |
| `error` | `repo.setError` (OrganizationRepository.ts:165) | Extraction failed |

### Problem: "uploaded" Is Misleading

The invoice record is only inserted into the database **after** R2 confirms the upload is complete (via R2 notification → worker → org-agent). So by the time the DB record exists, the file is already uploaded. The status immediately transitions: `uploaded` → `extracting` in the same `onInvoiceUpload` handler (organization-agent.ts). The `uploaded` status is effectively a transient intermediate state that users rarely see.

### Problem: "extracted" Doesn't Fit Manual Invoices

When a user creates an invoice manually (no file, no extraction), the invoice is immediately usable. Calling it "extracted" is wrong — nothing was extracted.

### Proposed Status Model

| Status | Meaning | When Set |
|---|---|---|
| `extracting` | Extraction workflow running | Upload flow: on invoice insert (R2 notification received) |
| `ready` | Invoice data is available for use | Upload flow: extraction completes. Manual flow: on create. |
| `error` | Extraction or processing failed | Upload flow: extraction fails |
| `deleted` | Soft-deleted | Delete action (replaces current hard delete) |

**Removed:**
- `uploaded` — not needed. Record is inserted with `extracting` since extraction kicks off immediately upon insert.
- `extracted` — renamed to `ready` (or alternative, see below).

**Added:**
- `deleted` — for soft-delete.

### Status Lifecycle: Upload Flow (Revised)

```
R2 notification received → worker → org-agent.onInvoiceUpload
  → repo.upsertInvoice()          status: "extracting"
  → runWorkflow(EXTRACTION)
  → extraction completes
    → repo.saveExtraction()        status: "ready"
  OR extraction fails
    → repo.setError()              status: "error"
```

No more `uploaded` → `extracting` two-step. The record starts at `extracting`.

### Status Lifecycle: Manual Create Flow

```
createInvoice server fn → org-agent.createInvoice
  → repo.upsertInvoice()          status: "ready"
```

Immediately `ready` — no extraction needed.

### Status Lifecycle: Soft Delete

```
deleteInvoice server fn
  → auth check
  → get org agent stub
  → stub.softDeleteInvoice(invoiceId)
    → repo.softDeleteInvoice(invoiceId)    status: "deleted"
    → broadcastActivity("Invoice deleted")
```

No R2 deletion. No queue message. No R2 notification. The file stays in R2; the invoice row stays in the DB with status `deleted` and is filtered from default queries.

## Question 3: Is "ready" the Right Name?

### Options Considered

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | Clear intent: invoice is ready for use/review | Slightly vague — ready for what? |
| `active` | Common SaaS status term, clear meaning | Could imply ongoing activity vs. static data |
| `complete` | Indicates all data is present | Manual invoices start "complete" with no data — contradictory? |
| `available` | Neutral, indicates accessibility | Uncommon in status enums |
| `draft` | Familiar term for editable documents | Implies not finalized; but extracted invoices are also "ready" — calling them draft is confusing |

### Assessment

`ready` works well for both flows:
- Upload: extraction done, invoice data ready for review
- Manual: invoice created, ready for user to populate

The alternative `active` is also reasonable but has a different connotation (ongoing vs. available). `complete` is misleading for manual invoices that start empty.

<!-- REVIEW: Preference between "ready" and "active"? Or another option? -->

## Question 4: Other Statuses to Consider

### Statuses We Considered and Rejected (For Now)

| Status | Why Considered | Why Not Now |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Manual invoice creation research proposed it | Adds complexity. If manual invoices are immediately `ready`, a separate `draft` state just means "ready but empty" which the UI can determine from data presence. If we later want explicit draft→finalized workflow, we can add it then. |
| `uploading` | Track in-progress uploads | Not needed — DB record is only created after R2 confirms upload complete. Upload progress is client-side only. |
| `uploaded` | Current status | Redundant — extraction starts immediately on insert. |
| `sent` | Invoice sent to recipient | Out of scope — no send/share functionality yet. |
| `paid` / `overdue` | Payment tracking | Out of scope — no payment tracking yet. |
| `archived` | Hide without deleting | `deleted` (soft delete) serves the same purpose for now. |
| `processing` | Generic "something happening" | `extracting` is more specific and descriptive. |

### Recommended Final Status Set

```typescript
export const InvoiceStatusValues = [
  "extracting",
  "ready",
  "error",
  "deleted",
] as const;
```

Four statuses. Minimal, each with clear meaning and a specific lifecycle trigger.

## Soft Delete Implementation

### Deletable Statuses

Only invoices in `ready` or `error` can be soft-deleted. Invoices in `extracting` cannot — the running workflow would set status to `ready` or `error` and overwrite the `deleted` status.

<!-- REVIEW: For `extracting` invoices, should the trash icon be hidden entirely, or shown but disabled? Hidden for now since it's simpler and the extraction is typically fast. -->

Should only be shown if status is ready or error.

### Current Delete Flow (Hard Delete)

```
invoices.tsx deleteInvoice server fn
  → auth check
  → r2.delete(data.r2ObjectKey)                    ← deletes file from R2
  → (local) queue.send({ action: "DeleteObject" }) ← triggers queue processing
  → (prod) R2 notification fires automatically
    → worker.ts processInvoiceDelete
      → parseInvoiceObjectKey(key)
      → stub.onInvoiceDelete({ invoiceId, r2ActionTime, r2ObjectKey })
        → repo.deleteInvoice(invoiceId, r2ActionTime)   ← SQL: delete from Invoice
        → broadcastActivity("Invoice deleted")
```

### Proposed Delete Flow (Soft Delete)

```
invoices.tsx deleteInvoice server fn
  → auth check
  → get org agent stub
  → stub.softDeleteInvoice(invoiceId)
    → repo.softDeleteInvoice(invoiceId)    ← SQL: update set status = 'deleted'
    → broadcastActivity("Invoice deleted")
```

Need logic to ensure deleting invoice that is in ready.

**What's removed from the flow:**
- No `r2.delete()` — file stays in R2
- No queue message (local env)
- No R2 notification processing (prod env)
- No `r2ActionTime` concurrency guard needed — soft delete is a simple status update

### Changes by File

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/routes/app.$organizationId.invoices.tsx` | `deleteInvoice` server fn: remove R2 delete, remove queue message, call `stub.softDeleteInvoice(invoiceId)` directly. `deleteInvoiceSchema`: remove `r2ObjectKey` field (only `invoiceId` needed). Trash icon: only render when `status === "ready" \|\| status === "error"`. |
| `src/organization-agent.ts` | Add `@callable() softDeleteInvoice(invoiceId)` method. `onInvoiceDelete`: keep for now (R2 delete notifications from outside the app could still arrive) or remove — see open question. |
| `src/lib/OrganizationRepository.ts` | Add `softDeleteInvoice`: `update Invoice set status = 'deleted' where id = ? and status in ('ready', 'error')`. Replace or keep `deleteInvoice` — see open question. |
| `src/lib/OrganizationRepository.ts` | `getInvoices`: add `where status != 'deleted'` filter. |
| `src/worker.ts` | `processInvoiceDelete`: becomes dead code since the app no longer triggers R2 deletions. Keep for safety (external R2 deletes) or remove. |

### Open Questions

<!-- REVIEW: Should we remove `onInvoiceDelete` and `processInvoiceDelete` (the hard-delete R2 notification path) now, or keep them as dead code for safety? They'd only fire if something outside the app deletes an R2 object. Leaning toward keeping them — they're harmless and provide a safety net. But the hard `delete from Invoice` SQL in `repo.deleteInvoice` would need to stay too if we keep it. -->

Remove dead code

<!-- REVIEW: R2 cleanup strategy — files stay in R2 indefinitely after soft delete. Future options: (1) scheduled cleanup job that deletes R2 objects for invoices in `deleted` status older than N days, (2) manual purge action, (3) never clean up (storage cost). Not blocking for this implementation. -->

Defer. No need to mention.
